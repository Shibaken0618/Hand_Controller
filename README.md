# PC Hand Gesture Controller:
There once was a time when I was so lazy to the point of where changing the volume, brightness, and even scrolling with the mouse wheel felt too tedious. This couch potato-like though led to the creation of this app.
This is a Python app to allow users to control volume, screen scroll, and brightness with hand gestures.
The three main functions that can be controller with this app are the screen volume, brightness, and scrolling.

## Instructions:
When the app is running, it would be connected with your default camera, and have the camera open. 
Put one of your hand in the camera frame to allow the hand gesture controls to start working. 
On the bottom of the app, it will indicate the current mode:

## Modes:

### Mode Switching:
Put your thumb, index finger, and pinky up (rock & roll sign) to switch between the modes. 

### Volume:
With your index finger and thumb, move them closer together to decrease volume, and move them away to increase volume. Volume can also increase decrease depending on how close you move your hand to the camera, where the closer the hand is, the higher the volume. 

### Brightness:
With your index finger and thumb, move them closer together to decrease brightness, and move them away to increase brightness. Same as volume, moving your hand closer to the camera would increase volume, and if moved farther away, decreases volume.

### Scrolling:
Using your index finger, by pointing it up, it would scroll the current active screen continuously until the finger is put away. By pointing it down, it would scroll down until the finger is put away.
